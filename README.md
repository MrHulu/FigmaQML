#  FigmaQML  #

FigmaQML  is  an  application  to  generate  [Figma](https://www.figma.com)  designs  to  [QML](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtqml-index.html)  sourcecode for  [QtQuick](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-index.html)  applications.

##  Run  ##

 *  FigmaQML  can  be  run  either  in  command-line  or  as  a  gui  application.
 *  Basically  it  is  started  on  command-line  if  target  directory  (QML_DIRECTORY)  is  given  as  a  parameter.
 *  Basic  Command  line  format  is  TOKEN  PROJECT  QML_DIRECTORY
         *  For  flags  and  other  options  see  --help
         *  For  MacOSX  the  commandline  refers  inside  of  application  bundle:  i.e.  <code>$  FigmaQML.app/Contents/MacOS/FigmaQML</code>  
 *  If  started  as  a  command  line  mode,  the  QtQuick  tab  shows  the  generated  UI.
 *  Note:  rendering  generated  UI  does  not  match  with  the performance  of  real  application  UI  as QML  will be  pre-compiled.  

###  Binaries  ###

*  For  [Windows  10](https://github.com/mmertama/FigmaQML/releases)
*  For  [Mac  OSX](https://github.com/mmertama/FigmaQML/releases)
*  For  Ubuntu,  binaries  release  is  not  available,  please  compile  from  sources.

###  Quick  guide  to  FigmaQML  UI  ###

*  **Tokens**
        *  Set  your  user  [account  token ](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens) and  project  token.  
        *  To get project token open  your  Figma  Document  on  the  browser  and  see  the  URL.  The  project  token  is  as  highlighted:  https://www.figma.com/file/bPWNMoKnXkXgf71S9cFX7G/â€¦
*  **Export  all  QMLs**
        *    Generates  QML  code  and  related  images  into  given  directory.
*  **Imports** edit  QML  "imports"  statement.  
*  **Store** saves  the  current  project.
*  **Restore** reads  a  project  from  a  file.
*  '**Source**',  '**Figma**',  '**QtQuick**'  -  show  generated  source,  project  JSON  or  draw  the  generated  Frame.
*  A  Figma  project  is  having  one  or  more  pages.  FigmaQML  expects  that  each  page  contains  one  or  more  views  when  a  view  is  typically  a  frame  or  group. 
*  **Connect**  starts  requesting  project  data  periodically  from  the  Figma  Server.  When server is connected at first time,  all  the document data  is  retrieved,  then  trancoded  to  QML  and  rendered  to  UI.  After  that  FigmaQML  polls  the  changes  at  the  server.  Therefore  the  modifications  made  in  Figma  application  are  reflected  to  the  FigmaQML  more  or  less  instantly  depending  on  design's  size.
*  **Disconnect** stops  polling  from  the  server.
*  **Settings**:
        *  Break  booleans:  Generate  code  where  each  child  element  that  composites  a  Figma  Boolean  element  are  generated.  By  default  only  the  composed  shape  Item  is  produced.
        * Embed  images:  Creates  stand-alone  QML  files  that  have  images  written  in  the  QML  code  instead  of  generating  and  referring  to  image  files.
        * Render  view:  Set  the  view  to  be  rendered  on  the  Figma  Server,  and  the  generated  UI  is  just  an  image.  Handy  to  compare  rendering  results. 
         *  Antialize  shapes:  Whether  "antialized:  true"  property  is  set  on  each  shape.  To  improve  rendering  quality  FigmaQML  sets  global  multisampling  to  improve  preview  rendering  quality,  using  next  code  snippet:
  <pre>
  QSurfaceFormat  format;
  format.setSamples(8);
  QSurfaceFormat::setDefaultFormat(format);
  </pre>
*  **Change  page  and  change  view** changes  displayed  source  code  are  rendered  UI  view.  
*  **Component** Is  displayed  only  when  the  source  code  tab  is  activated.  If  the  currently  rendered  view  contains  QML,  here  user  can  select  if  the  view's  QML  source  or  the  source  code  of  any  of  the  components  that  are  generated  along  the  view  is  shown.  Components  are  discussed  later  in  this  document.  
*  **Scaling**:  let  the  user  to  zoom  in  and  out  the  current  rendering.  
*  **Ctrl+C**  copies  the  current  text  view  to  the  clipboard.

#### Testing
There  are  few  scripts  in  [test]()  folder  that  are  used  for  testing.  Since  test  data  itself  is  under  personal  Figma  account,  there  are  no  automated  tests distributed  along  FigmaQML.  However  if  you  have  a  good  set  of  Figma  documents  available  you  can  execute  tests  using  next  example:
  <pre>
  export  IMAGE_COMPARE="python  ../figmaQML/test/imagecomp.py"
  export  IMAGE_TRESHOLD="0.90"
  token=123456-aaaabbbbb-cccc-dddd-8888-1234567890
  echo  "Test  time:  $(date)"  >>  test_log.txt  
  {
  echo  Test_no:  1
  ../figmaQML/test/runtest.sh  ../figmaQML/Release/FigmaQML  $token  Nku226IVrvZtsRc71QJyWx
  if  [  $?  -ne  0  ];  then  echo  fail;  exit;  fi
.....
  echo  Test_no:  3  
  ../figmaQML/test/runtest.sh  ../figmaQML/Release/FigmaQML  $token  OZcdWgROy0Czk0JASRF21v  "2-10"
  if  [  $?  -ne  0  ];  then  echo  fail;  exit;  fi
  echo  Test_no:  4
  ../figmaQML/test/runtest_image.sh  ../figmaQML/Release/FigmaQML  "2-3"
  if  [  $?  -ne  0  ];  then  echo  fail;  exit;  fi
  echo  Test_no:  5  
  ../figmaQML/test/runtest_image.sh  ../figmaQML/Release/FigmaQML  "2-4"
  if  [  $?  -ne  0  ];  then  echo  fail;  exit;  fi
  echo  Test_no:  6  
  ../figmaQML/test/runtest.sh  ../figmaQML/Release/FigmaQML  $token  bZDWbBfInVrD1ijuIJZD88WG
  if  [  $?  -ne  0  ];  then  echo  fail;  exit;  fi
....  
  echo  Test_no:  done
  }  2>  test_errors.txt  |  tee  -a  test_log.txt  
  </pre>

  *  $token  is  your  Figma  user  token.
  *  Parameter  after  that  is  a  test  project  token.
  *  Optional  third  parameter  is  a  Canvas-view  to  be  tested  (default  is  1-1)
  *  runtest.sh  fetch  data  from  Figma  server  and  runs  basic  QML  generation  test  on  that
  *  runtest_image  let  run  additional  image  tests  on  data  without  furher  data  retrive.  (Figma  service  has  data  quota)
  *  image  test  compares  Figma  rendered  Canvas-view  and  FigmaQML  rendered  canvas  view  (see  IMAGE_COMPARE  above)  and  provides  fuzzy  match  value  between  0  and  1.
  *  Here  I  have  been  using  value  0.9,  "90%  same"),  (see  IMAGE_TRESHOLD  above)  to  pass  the  test.
  *  Note:  You  may  have  to  install  SSIM_PIL  from  https://github.com/mmertama/SSIM-PIL.git  as  that  wont  show  they  annoying  warning  about  pyopencl  windows  (also  on  OSX)  even  the  GPU=FALSE  as  below.
